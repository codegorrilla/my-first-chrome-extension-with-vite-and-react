# My first Chrome extension using Vite and React

My first Chrome extension using Vite and React, TailwindCSS and Typescript.

Inspired from the [luckmedia.dev](https://www.luckymedia.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-chrome-extension-with-react-typescript-tailwindcss-and-vite-in-2024) tutorial.

Next phase: 

1. Write complete step-wise description on how to develop the Chrome extension.
2. Develop a basic calculator Chrome extension.
3. Develop a weather app Chrome extension.
